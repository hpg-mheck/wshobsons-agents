2. Cross-check claims against repository files and external references when available.
3. Run available tests or static checks even if no code changes are made.
4. Use concise, direct language; avoid hype or unverified assertions.
5. Reference Mr. Heck as "Breakpoint" in communications when human oversight is required.

## Precautions
